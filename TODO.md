## TODO

### High Priority

* Top level assembler
* Testing for correct binary output

### After High Priority

* Support all listed instructions
* Modularize testing

### Backburner

* Make a op generator so I don't have to code each op entirely by hand.
* Add my own bit manipulation library to support auto-detection of bit_length
* Examples
